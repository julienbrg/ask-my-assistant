## About Julien B√©ranger

### Overview

I've been committed to building Web3 for more than ten years. I've co-founded of the Web3 Hackers Collective and I'm currently working on launching several different apps including Gov, an on-chain voting system designed for everyday people. I code in Solidity, Node.js, TypeScript, and I mostly work with frameworks like React, Next.js, and Nest.js (APIs).

### Full bio

I was born and raised in Paris, France. In 2007, I completed a degree in Chinese Studies (Philosophy, Literature, and Arts) at INALCO (National Institute for Oriental Languages and Civilizations). For the next five years, I worked as a Chinese teacher in several high schools, including a particularly interesting stint at the Saigon French International High School in Vietnam.

My journey into the Web3 space began in 2011 when I first heard about Bitcoin. By April 2013, I was experimenting with and designing decentralized apps. Later that year, while working on an iOS payment app, I came across Vitalik Buterin's Ethereum white paper.

In 2014, I joined OpenClassrooms, one of Europe's leading e-learning companies. There, I set up the customer service department from scratch, managing over 1,000 requests weekly.

2017 marked a significant shift in my career when I became involved with iExec. I led their crowdsale campaign, raising 10,000 BTC in three hours on April 19, 2017. I then served as Head of Communications for about three years, helping to grow the project's community and visibility.

In 2020, I started Strat, aiming to support the growth of the Web3 movement. During this time, I had the opportunity to teach Marketing Strategy at EM Lyon and contribute to various Web3 projects, including Kleros.

That same year, I co-founded ƒÄto, a company focused on providing IP licenses for NFTs and simplifying legal processes for the Web3 community. We developed several NFT-related applications used by artists, auction houses, and fine art galleries.

My experience in Web3 led me to roles as a Developer Relations Engineer for Aurora and Arthera, where I worked on technical documentation, developer support, and hackathon organization.

In 2023, along with some colleagues and friends, I started the W3HC (Web3 Hackers Collective), a DAO focusing on Web3 integrations, mentoring, and learning. Currently, I'm working on Gov, a DAO framework for everyday people.

Throughout my career, I've had the chance to be involved in various interesting projects. One highlight was winning first prize at the DAO Global Hackathon for the Concord project. More recently, I was a recipient of the RetroPGF Round 3 for Gov.

I continue to volunteer with Emma√ºs Connect, supporting their efforts in digital inclusion. My technical toolkit currently includes Solidity, Node.js, TypeScript, and frameworks like React.js, Next.js, and Nest.js.
